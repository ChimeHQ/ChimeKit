## Scenes

UI-based extensions define their view in terms of scenes which conform to ``ChimeExtensionScene``. ChimeKit includes predefined scenes that you can use. 

- ``SidebarScene``: Used with fixed-sidebar extensions. See <doc:SidebarExtension>.
- ``DocumentSyncedScene``: Used with document-synced extensions.
