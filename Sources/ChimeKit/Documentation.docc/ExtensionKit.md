# ExtensionKit Support

Pre-built components for building ExtensionKit extensions.

## Overview

Chime can load ExtensionKit-based extensions at runtime. ChimeKit provides a number of abstractions you can use to build extensions without needing to understand the lower-level details of ExtensionKit and the extension-host communcation systems.

## Topics

### Defining Extensions

- ``ChimeExtension``
- ``ChimeExtensionPoint``

### Defining User Interfaces

- ``SidebarChimeUIExtension``
- ``DocumentSyncedChimeUIExtension``
